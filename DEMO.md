# Claude Code Hooks Demo - Before vs After

## 🚨 BEFORE: Your Current GitHub Workflow

```bash
# Developer makes changes
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "fixed stuff"  # Vague message
$ git push

# What actually gets pushed:
- ❌ Console.logs still in code
- ❌ Broken tests
- ❌ No type checking
- ❌ Inconsistent formatting  
- ❌ TODO comments without issue tracking
- ❌ Changelog never updated
- ❌ Potential secrets in code
```

Result: Sloppy repos, broken builds, confused team members

## ✅ AFTER: With Claude Code Hooks

```bash
# Developer makes changes
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "fixed login bug"

# Claude Code automatically:
🔍 Running pre-commit checks...
📋 Checking for sloppy code patterns...
   ❌ Found console.log statements (remove for production code)
   ❌ Found TODO without issue numbers
🧹 Running linter...
   ❌ Linting failed
   
❌ Pre-commit checks failed. Fix the issues above and try again.

# After fixing issues:
$ git commit -m "fixed login bug"

✅ All pre-commit checks passed!
📝 Commit formatted as: fix(JIRA-123): fixed login bug
📋 CHANGELOG.md updated automatically
```

## 🎯 Quick Wins for Your Team

### 1. **No More Broken Commits**
Pre-commit hook runs tests/linting BEFORE code gets pushed

### 2. **Standardized Commit Messages**
Automatically formats to conventional commits with ticket numbers

### 3. **Automatic Documentation**
Changelog updates itself with every commit

### 4. **Security First**
Catches hardcoded API keys and secrets before they're committed

### 5. **Clean Code Enforcement**
No more console.logs, proper TODOs, consistent formatting

## 🚀 Setup (30 seconds)

```bash
# In any existing repo:
curl -sL https://your-template-url/scripts/quick-setup.sh | bash

# Or clone the template:
git clone [template-repo] my-new-project
cd my-new-project
./scripts/quick-setup.sh
```

## 💡 Why Your Boss Will Love This

- **Consistency**: Every repo follows the same standards
- **Automation**: No more reminding devs about best practices
- **Visibility**: Clear commit history and changelogs
- **Security**: Catches issues before they hit production
- **Zero Learning Curve**: It just works in the background

## 📊 ROI Example

**Before**: Dev spends 15 min/day on manual checks, formatting, updating docs
**After**: 0 minutes - it's all automated

**Team of 10 devs = 25 hours/week saved** 🎉
